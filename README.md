# 🚗 Auto MPG Analysis & Prediction

This project explores the relationships between various automobile engine and design attributes and their impact on fuel efficiency (MPG - Miles Per Gallon). Using data visualization and statistical modeling, we derive insights and build predictive models for MPG.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Tools Used**: 
  - R programming for data cleaning, visualization, and regression modeling
  - Tableau Public for interactive dashboard visualizations

## 📊 Visualizations
An interactive Tableau dashboard highlights key trends and distributions:
- Scatterplot Matrix
- Weight vs MPG
- MPG by Cylinder (Box Plot)

## 📈 Modeling & Prediction
Regression models were developed using the first 300 samples:
- **Simple Linear Regression** for each independent variable
- **Multiple Linear Regression** combining multiple predictors

### Metrics Reported:
- Multiple R-squared
- Adjusted R-squared
- Full regression equations

Predictions were then made for the remaining 98 samples, and evaluated using:
- Residual plots
- Histogram of residuals
- RMSE, MAE, and MSE metrics
